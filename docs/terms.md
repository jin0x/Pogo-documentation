# Terms of Use Settings

> In this section you can configure the content of the Terms page


Just head over to `Pages -> All Pages` in the backend and choose `Terms of Use`.

Inside this page you will find a static section at the beginning of the page which includes the static text which is shown at the top of the Terms of Use page.


After this section you may find a section named `Page - Terms of Use`

In this section you have the ability to add different page content sections. This section consists of the title and the content fields.
The title is used in both the Table of contents at the top of this page and also inside each individual section of the page.

Please note that you have to add the title of each individual section only once as these sections are dynamically populated at the frontend without the need to add them twice.

Also please note that the scrolling functionality to each individual section once you press on ay of the title of the table of contents is done programmatically.
