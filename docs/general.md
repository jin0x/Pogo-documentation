### Site Identity
-------------------

> In this section you can configure all the basic site identity options like Main Logo, Footer Logo, Site Title, etc. 


Head to `Appearance -> Customize` and then choose the `Site Identity` Menu.

Here you have the ability to change the Main logo which is used at the header of the site, Footer logo that is used at the footer of the site, Site Title and Tag line which are used for general SEO purposes, Footer copyrights which are placed at the footer socket of the site and the Site icon which is used as a favicon on the browser tab.

The images format can be pretty much everything from jpg, jpeg, png, svg and gif but it is always better to use SVG format because they leave very small footprint in terms of byte size on the site. Other good alternative is PNG because it provides the ability for logos with transparency so they can be used in many different backgrounds other than white.

For the Site Title and Tagline, you can use pretty much everything but you still need to consider meaningful content that will help you boost your SEO.

The Site icon can be either a GIF, PNG OR SVG and needs to be at least 512x512 px in size for pixel based image formats like GIF or PNG. SVG doesn't need any specific pixels as it is vector based format.
Of course you can use smaller resolution images like 128x128 or even 64x64 but this will make the logo more blurry and less high resolution for retina screens.

This section is used in case you want to override some CSS of the site and you don't want to mess with theme files.
Due to the reason that the CSS on the site is compiled into a minified version, it is always recommended if you are not a theme developer or WordPress expert in general, to not touch those files
