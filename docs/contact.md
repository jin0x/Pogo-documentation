# Contact Page Settings

> In this section you can configure the contact details shown at the Contact page


The only option that you have in this page is to just choose the `Contact Details` custom block from the add `Blocks` dropdown at the top left hand side.
This custom block is already in place for this page and please note that you can pretty much use it on any page that you want to populate all your contact details.

All the options for this block are configured through the `Contact Details` inside `Appearance -> Customize` menu item and they are dynamically populated inside this `Contact Details` block
