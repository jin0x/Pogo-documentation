# Leadership Page Settings

> In this section you can configure the Leadership page and how to populate content inside this page.


This page consists of two different options. One is a `Leadership` Custom Post Type which can be found at the backend of the site and is used to add, edit or remove leadership members.

Just head to the backend of the site and choose the `Leadership` menu from the admin sidebar. Inside this page you can see all leadership members and you have the following actions (delete, add new or edit existing member).

The options that each individual member supports are the following ones:

* Name (which is the title of the post type)
* Bio (which is the main content of this post type)
* Position (which can be found at the bottom of each individual post type inside Leadership member - Options)


The next step after you store all the individual members in the backend, is to populate them at the front end.
Just head to `Pages -> All Page` in the admin sidebar and then choose `Leadership`. Inside this page you will find 2 individual blocks:

* Leadership Members
* Small List


The first custom block is used to populate the individual members of the site and it only has one option, to choose the members and sort them in the order that you want. 
Everything else is done programmatically to show them at the front end.

The second custom block is used to populate the list below all leadership members and you have many options for the list, like if it has bullets on the list items or if we want to manipulate the size of the list items.
