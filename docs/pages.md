# Pages Settings

> In this section you can configure all the static pages across the site


To configure all the other pages of the site, you just have to navigate to `Pages -> All Pages` and just choose the page that you want to modify.

If you want to create a new page just navigate to `Pages -> Add New`

The editing/publishing experience of the site uses the new WordPress Editor named `Gutenberg` which provides a better publishing experience over the old WordPress WYSIWYG Editor.
